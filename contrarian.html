        <h1>Contrarian Truths</h1>
        <h4>important truths that i think most people would disagree with me on</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p> most people don't truly want absolute freedom because it comes with overwhelming responsibility.
                People might say they want freedom, but in reality, they prefer some structure or authority to avoid the anxiety of choice.
                which is why societal structures, traditions, and even authoritarian elements are subconsciously welcomed because they provide a sense of order.
                
                
            </p></li>
            <li><p>there is some truth to everything but our reality is shaped around what we value more. e.g: democracy is not the best form of governance but we don't want to risk being under a dictatorship again so that we can have our illusions of freedom.
                    which is better than actually feeling like we have no freedom. we'd rather have a worse governance system which isnt the most efficient than be under a very efficient and effective dictatorship.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>order is important for growth and sustainability but our truly happiest moments are in chaos. 
                all happiness is an outcome of choatic processes.   
                conservatives value a long term stability(order) more and leftists value individual happiness(chaos) over all of that. </p></li>
            <li><p>letting the weak rely on the strong is limiting the weak and making them stay weak</p></li>
            <li><p>We are all selfish. True selflessness doesn't exist in human nature</p></li> 
            <li><p></p></li>
